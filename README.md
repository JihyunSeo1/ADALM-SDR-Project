Wireless Communication SDR Project

Welcome to the Wireless Communication SDR Project repository! This repository contains all the codes and implementations related to my work on Software Defined Radio (SDR), focusing on synchronization, modulation techniques, and signal processing.

Project Overview

This project explores various wireless communication concepts using PlutoSDR and other DSP techniques. Key areas covered include:

Frame Synchronization: Implementing self-reference frame synchronization using Barker sequences.

Modulation Techniques: BPSK modulation, pulse shaping using RRC filters, and upsampling.

Error Correction Coding: Exploring methods for improving transmission reliability.

Music File Transmission: Transmitting raw audio files over SDR while ensuring accurate reception.
