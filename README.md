Welcome to the **Wireless Communication SDR Project** repository! This repository contains all the codes and implementations related to my work on Software Defined Radio (SDR), focusing on synchronization, modulation techniques, and signal processing.

## Project Overview

This project explores various wireless communication concepts using **PlutoSDR** and other DSP techniques. Key areas covered include:

- **Frame Synchronization**: Implementing self-reference frame synchronization using Barker sequences.
- **Modulation Techniques**: BPSK modulation, pulse shaping using RRC filters, and upsampling.
- **Error Correction Coding**: Exploring methods for improving transmission reliability.
- **Image Transmission **: Transmitting raw image files over SDR while ensuring accurate reception.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
- GNU Radio (optional, for further SDR experiments)
- PlutoSDR drivers and libraries
